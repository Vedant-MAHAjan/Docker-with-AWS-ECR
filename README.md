# üê≥ Docker with AWS ECR üöÄ

## Creating a Docker Image üì∏
Every Docker image requires a Dockerfile for building an image. The image are formed in layer-by-layer stucture

## Keywords of the Dockerfile

- The ```FROM``` command specifies the base image for the build stage.
- The ```WORKDIR``` command sets the working directory for the build stage.
- The ```COPY``` command copies files from the local machine to the Docker image.
- The ```RUN``` command runs a command in the Docker image.

## How to run the Dockerfile... üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile...

#### Run

```docker build -f <name_of_Dockerfile> -t image_name:version_name .```

The version name can be anything like 1.0, version_1, etc.

## Explanation of the Dockerfile

There are 3 files with each file reducing the size of the final image.

### Dockerfile1
This is the basic Dockerfile with the maximum image size

```
FROM node
WORKDIR /app    
COPY package.json .   
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

- The base image is node with working directory as ```/app```. 
The ```package.json``` file is copied to ```/app``` (this takes advantage of layer caching in Docker). The dependencies are installed and 
the rest of the files are copied to ```/app```. 
The appropriate ```port 3000``` is exposed (this command has no change on the final image, it is used just as information)
and the start the app 

## Dockerfile2
This file uses multi-stage builds. Since only build files are required to serve the site, 
all the other files are not copied into the final image thus reducing it's size.

```
# Stage 1
FROM node:12-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . /app
RUN npm run build 

# Stage 2
FROM node:12-alpine
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install -g webserver.local
COPY --from=build /app/build ./build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD webserver.local -d ./build
```
- The 1st stage or build stage creates a ```build``` folder inside the app directory after executing the build command. 
The ```webserver.local``` package is used to serve the built files

## Dockerfile3
This file uses Nginx to serve the site as it compatible and thus helps reduce the image size

```
# Stage1
FROM node:12-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . /app
RUN npm run build 

# Stage2
FROM nginx:stable-alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
- The built files are copied to the ```/nginx/html``` directory and then served using nginx server

## Pushing the image to AWS ECR ‚òÅ
- AWS Elastic Container Registry is a private registry for storing Docker images. 
- It uses a single repository to store one image.
- But the versions of that same image can exist in the same repository. 

### Steps üî¢

1. Create an IAM user in AWS named "Docker"
2. Add the permission ```AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess``` to that user
3. Create a ```access key``` for AWS CLI and copy the ```access key``` and the ```secret key```
4. Login to ```AWS CLI``` using these credentials 
5. Go to ```Amazon Elastic Container Registry``` and create a new repository
6. Click on the repository and open ```View Push commands```
7. Copy the commands one by one to push the Docker image to the registry.
8. Make sure that the image name is same as the repository name.
